**What is Rx?**

ReactiveX is a library for composing asynchronous and event-based programs by using observable sequences.

An **Observable** is like an array - in time.

**Observable.d.ts Documentation**

A representation of any set of values over any amount of time. This is the most basic building block of RxJS

**Observables**

- declarative
- are lazy (cold vs hot)
- non-blocking
- accepts observers
- made for async
- best for handling events too
- composable
- functional(ish)
